Can you provide a shorter summary to be used as a snippet on the landing page?\\n###Input: \\\"Apple Inc. reported its quarterly earnings results yesterday. The company posted a record-breaking revenue of $123.9 billion for the first quarter of 2022, up by 11% from the same period last year. The increase was fueled by stronger demand for iPhones, iPads, and Macs, as well as continued growth in its services segment. Apple's operating profit for the quarter came in at $38.3 billion, up 17% from a year earlier. The results surpassed analysts' expectations, who had anticipated revenue of around $118 billion. This strong performance is largely attributed to the successful launch of the iPhone 13, which has enjoyed robust sales since its debut in September. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement, \\\"Our record-breaking quarter reflects the strength of our entire ecosystem, from our innovative products and services to the unmatched dedication of our teams around the world.\\\" Despite the ongoing global supply chain disruptions, Apple has managed to maintain its growth trajectory, thanks in part to its vertically integrated operations and nimble supply chain management.
