NCB will pay 28.45 riyals ($7.58) for each Samba share, according to a statement on Sunday, valuing it at about 55.7 billion riyals. NCB will offer 0.739 new shares for each Samba share, at the lower end of the 0.736-0.787 ratio the banks set when they signed an initial framework agreement in June. The offer is a 3.5% premium to Samba's Oct. 8 closing price of 27.50 riyals and about 24% higher than the level the shares traded at before the talks were made public. Bloomberg News first reported the merger discussions. The new bank will have total assets of more than $220 billion, creating the Gulf region's third-largest lender.

Summarize the email content in 2-3 sentences.\\n###Input: India wicket-keeper batsman Rishabh Pant has said someone from the crowd threw a ball on pacer Mohammed Siraj while he was fielding in the ongoing third Test against England on Wednesday. Pant revealed the incident made India skipper Virat Kohli upset. I think, somebody threw a ball inside, at Siraj, so he [Kohli] was upset, said Pant in a virtual press conference after the close of the first day's play. You can say whatever you want to chant, but don't throw things at the fielders and all those things. It is not good for cricket, I guess, he added. In the third session of the opening day of the third Test, a section of spectators seemed to have asked Siraj the score of the match to tease the pacer. The India pacer, however, came with a brilliant reply as he gestured 1-0 (India leading the Test series) towards the crowd. Earlier this month, during the second Test match, there was some bad crowd behavior on a show as some unruly fans threw champagne corks at India batsman KL Rahul. Kohli also intervened and he was seen gesturing towards the opening batsman to know more about the incident. An over later, the TV visuals showed that many champagne corks were thrown inside the playing field, and the Indian players were visibly left frustrated. Coming back to the game, after bundling out India for 78, openers Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed ensured that England took the honours on the opening day of the ongoing third Test. At stumps, England's score reads 120/0 and the hosts have extended their lead to 42 runs. For the Three Lions, Burns (52) and Hameed (60) are currently unbeaten at the crease. Talking about the pitch on opening day, Pant said, \\\"They took the heavy roller, the wicket was much more settled down, and they batted nicely also,\\\" he said. \\\"But when we batted, the wicket was slightly soft, and they bowled in good areas, but we could have applied [ourselves] much better.\\n", "category": "generic"}

Pant revealed the incident made India skipper Virat Kohli upset. I think, somebody threw a ball inside, at Siraj, so he [Kohli] was upset, said Pant in a virtual press conference after the close of the first day's play.You can say whatever you want to chant, but don't throw things at the fielders and all those things. It is not good for cricket, I guess, he added.In the third session of the opening day of the third Test, a section of spectators seemed to have asked Siraj the score of the match to tease the pacer. The India pacer however came with a brilliant reply as he gestured 1-0 (India leading the Test series) towards the crowd.Earlier this month, during the second Test match, there was some bad crowd behaviour on a show as some unruly fans threw champagne corks at India batsman KL Rahul.Kohli also intervened and he was seen gesturing towards the opening batsman to know more about the incident. An over later, the TV visuals showed that many champagne corks were thrown inside the playing field, and the Indian players were visibly left frustrated.Coming back to the game, after bundling out India for 78, openers Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed ensured that England took the honours on the opening day of the ongoing third Test.At stumps, England's score reads 120/0 and the hosts have extended their lead to 42 runs. For the Three Lions, Burns (52) and Hameed (60) are currently unbeaten at the crease.Talking about the pitch on opening day, Pant said, They took the heavy roller, the wicket was much more settled down, and they batted nicely also, he said. But when we batted, the wicket was slightly soft, and they bowled in good areas, but we could have applied [ourselves] much better.Both England batsmen managed to see off the final session and the hosts concluded the opening day with all ten wickets intact, extending the lead to 42.(ANI)\\n", "category": "generic"}

NCB will pay 28.45 riyals ($7.58) for each Samba share, according to a statement on Sunday, valuing it at about 55.7 billion riyals. NCB will offer 0.739 new shares for each Samba share, at the lower end of the 0.736-0.787 ratio the banks set when they signed an initial framework agreement in June. The offer is a 3.5% premium to Sambas Oct. 8 closing price of 27.50 riyals and about 24% higher than the level the shares traded at before the talks were made public. Bloomberg News first reported the merger discussions. The new bank will have total assets of more than $220 billion, creating the Gulf regions third-largest lender. The entitys $46 billion market capitalization nearly matches that of Qatar National Bank QPSC, which is still the Middle Easts biggest lender with about $268 billion of assets.\\n", "category": "generic"}

{"question_id": 3334, "text": " Summarize a long article about the effects of climate change on agriculture for a news website.\\n###Input: Climate change has been causing significant shifts in weather patterns, leading to unpredictable rainfall, extreme temperature fluctuations, and increased frequency of severe weather events. These changes in climate have profound implications for agriculture, as they can directly impact crop productivity and food security. Prolonged droughts, floods, and heatwaves can lead to diminished crop yields and decreased agricultural output, while erratic weather patterns can disrupt the delicate balance of pollinators and pests, further complicating agricultural production. Moreover, the unpredictability of rainfall can cause severe water scarcity in some areas, while increased evaporation rates may result in less available freshwater resources for irrigation. This, in turn, will put immense pressure on farmers, who are already grappling with the challenges of feeding a growing global population. In response to these challenges, scientists and policymakers are exploring various strategies for advancing agricultural resilience to climate change. Some approaches include adopting climate-smart agricultural practices, such as intercropping, agroforestry, and conservation agriculture, which can help mitigate the impact of climate change on crop productivity. Additionally, the development of new, drought-resistant crop varieties could prove essential in ensuring food security in the face of climate upheaval. On a broader scale, comprehensive climate change adaptation policies and investment in research, development, and technology transfer will play a critical role in enabling agricultural systems to better withstand the impacts of a changing climate. \\n", "category": "generic"}

The policy includes the termination of accounts of anti-vaccine influencers. Tech giants have been criticized for not doing more to counter false health information on their sites. In July, US President Joe Biden said social media platforms were largely responsible for people's skepticism in getting vaccinated by spreading misinformation, and appealed for them to address the issue. YouTube, which is owned by Google, said 130,000 videos were removed from its platform since last year when it implemented a ban on content spreading misinformation about Covid vaccines. In a blog post, the company said it had seen false claims about Covid jabs spill over into misinformation about vaccines in general.

The study of emergent properties in complex systems necessitates the development of novel mathematical tools and computational frameworks that can effectively analyze large-scale, multi-scale, and multi-modal data. In this paper, we proposed and investigated two novel mathematical approaches based on graph theory and information theory for the characterization of emergent properties in complex systems. The first approach was inspired by the concept of topological entropy from dynamical systems theory, which we adapted to analyze non-linear emergent dynamics of graphs. Our second approach derived a new set of complexity measures from multi-information and entropy principles, which allowed us to reliably distinguish between emergent and non-emergent systems.\\\"\\n", "category": "generic"}

The people of France were divided into three major social groups called 'Estates.' The First and Second Estates, which included the clergy and nobility, were exempt from most taxes and enjoyed enormous privileges. The Third Estate, comprising the majority of the population, bore the burden of these inequalities. Economic struggles worsened when high taxes, inflation, and bad harvests caused widespread poverty and hunger. The revolutionary ideas of the Enlightenment inspired the desire for more representative government and social reform. Unrest and dissatisfaction with the monarch, King Louis XVI, also contributed to the revolution.\\\"}\\n", "category": "generic"}

The most common methods include the 16:8 method, which involves fasting for 16 hours a day and eating during an eight-hour window, and the 5:2 method, which involves eating normally for five days a week and restricting calorie intake to 500-600 calories for the remaining two days. Advocates of intermittent fasting claim that it can lead to weight loss, improved metabolism, and increased energy levels. Some research supports these claims, with studies showing that intermittent fasting can help individuals lose weight, improve insulin sensitivity, and lower inflammation levels. However, not all experts agree on the benefits of intermittent fasting, as some argue that it can be difficult to adhere to for extended periods of time and may lead to disordered eating patterns or nutritional deficiencies. It is essential for individuals considering intermittent fasting to consult with a healthcare professional before making significant changes to their diet.\\\"\\n", "category": "generic"}

Tolkien tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, a seemingly ordinary and timid hobbit who resides in an idyllic community called the Shire. Bilbo comes from a long line of Bagginses known for their unadventurous nature, and he leads a quiet life until a wandering wizard named Gandalf comes to the Shire. Gandalf recruits Bilbo for an adventure, and soon the hobbit finds himself in the company of thirteen dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield, the heir to a lost dwarf kingdom. They embark on a journey to the Lonely Mountain in order to reclaim their stolen treasure from the dragon Smaug. Along the way, Bilbo faces many harrowing trials, including a confrontation with the magical creature Gollum, who possesses a special ring that makes its wearer invisible. Bilbo ultimately wins the ring from Gollum in a game of riddles and finds unexpected courage when he comes face to face with the formidable dragon. The journey changes Bilbo, and he returns to the Shire a wiser and more capable hobbit than before.\\\"\\n", "category": "generic"}

Pant revealed the incident made India skipper Virat Kohli upset. I think, somebody threw a ball inside, at Siraj, so he [Kohli] was upset, said Pant in a virtual press conference after the close of the first day's play.You can say whatever you want to chant, but don't throw things at the fielders and all those things. It is not good for cricket, I guess, he added.In the third session of the opening day of the third Test, a section of spectators seemed to have asked Siraj the score of the match to tease the pacer. The India pacer however came with a brilliant reply as he gestured 1-0 (India leading the Test series) towards the crowd.Earlier this month, during the second Test match, there was some bad crowd behaviour on a show as some unruly fans threw champagne corks at India batsman KL Rahul.Kohli also intervened and he was seen gesturing towards the opening batsman to know more about the incident. An over later, the TV visuals showed that many champagne corks were thrown inside the playing field, and the Indian players were visibly left frustrated.Coming back to the game, after bundling out India for 78, openers Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed ensured that England took the honours on the opening day of the ongoing third Test.At stumps, England's score reads 120/0 and the hosts have extended their lead to 42 runs. For the Three Lions, Burns (52) and Hameed (60) are currently unbeaten at the crease.Talking about the pitch on opening day, Pant said, They took the heavy roller, the wicket was much more settled down, and they batted nicely also, he said. But when we batted, the wicket was slightly soft, and they bowled in good areas, but we could have applied [ourselves] much better.Both England batsmen managed to see off the final session and the hosts concluded the opening day with all ten wickets intact, extending the lead to 42.\\n", "category": "generic"}

Provide me a summarized and concise version of the news article.\\n###Input: India wicket-keeper batsman Rishabh Pant has said someone from the crowd threw a ball on pacer Mohammed Siraj while he was fielding in the ongoing third Test against England on Wednesday. Pant revealed the incident made India skipper Virat Kohli upset. I think, somebody threw a ball inside, at Siraj, so he [Kohli] was upset, said Pant in a virtual press conference after the close of the first day's play.You can say whatever you want to chant, but don't throw things at the fielders and all those things. It is not good for cricket, I guess, he added.In the third session of the opening day of the third Test, a section of spectators seemed to have asked Siraj the score of the match to tease the pacer. The India pacer however came with a brilliant reply as he gestured 1-0 (India leading the Test series) towards the crowd.Earlier this month, during the second Test match, there was some bad crowd behaviour on a show as some unruly fans threw champagne corks at India batsman KL Rahul.Kohli also intervened and he was seen gesturing towards the opening batsman to know more about the incident. An over later, the TV visuals showed that many champagne corks were thrown inside the playing field, and the Indian players were visibly left frustrated.Coming back to the game, after bundling out India for 78, openers Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed ensured that England took the honours on the opening day of the ongoing third Test.At stumps, England's score reads 120/0 and the hosts have extended their lead to 42 runs. For the Three Lions, Burns (52) and Hameed (60) are currently unbeaten at the crease.Talking about the pitch on opening day, Pant said, They took the heavy roller, the wicket was much more settled down, and they batted nicely also, he said. But when we batted, the wicket was slightly soft, and they bowled in good areas, but we could have applied [ourselves] much better.Both England batsmen managed to see off the final session and the hosts concluded the opening day with all ten wickets intact, extending the lead to 42.(ANI)\\n", "category": "generic"}

NCB will pay 28.45 riyals ($7.58) for each Samba share, according to a statement on Sunday, valuing it at about 55.7 billion riyals. NCB will offer 0.739 new shares for each Samba share, at the lower end of the 0.736-0.787 ratio the banks set when they signed an initial framework agreement in June. The offer is a 3.5% premium to Sambas Oct. 8 closing price of 27.50 riyals and about 24% higher than the level the shares traded at before the talks were made public. Bloomberg News first reported the merger discussions. The new bank will have total assets of more than $220 billion, creating the Gulf regions third-largest lender.

{"question_id": 7053, "text": " Summarize the key information from this news article about a cricket incident.\\n###Input: \\nIndia wicket-keeper batsman Rishabh Pant has said someone from the crowd threw a ball on pacer Mohammed Siraj while he was fielding in the ongoing third Test against England on Wednesday. Pant revealed the incident made India skipper Virat Kohli upset. \\\"I think, somebody threw a ball inside, at Siraj, so he [Kohli] was upset,\\\" said Pant in a virtual press conference after the close of the first day's play. \\\"You can say whatever you want to chant, but don't throw things at the fielders and all those things. It is not good for cricket, I guess,\\\" he added. In the third session of the opening day of the third Test, a section of spectators seemed to have asked Siraj the score of the match to tease the pacer. The India pacer, however, came with a brilliant reply as he gestured 1-0 (India leading the Test series) towards the crowd. Earlier this month, during the second Test match, there was some bad crowd behavior on a show as some unruly fans threw champagne corks at India batsman KL Rahul. Kohli also intervened and he was seen gesturing towards the opening batsman to know more about the incident. An over later, the TV visuals showed that many champagne corks were thrown inside the playing field, and the Indian players were visibly left frustrated. Coming back to the game, after bundling out India for 78, openers Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed ensured that England took the honours on the opening day of the ongoing third Test. At stumps, England's score reads 120/0 and the hosts have extended their lead to 42 runs. For the Three Lions, Burns (52) and Hameed (60) are currently unbeaten at the crease. Talking about the pitch on the opening day, Pant said, \\\"They took the heavy roller, the wicket was much more settled down, and they batted nicely also,\\\" he said. \\\"But when we batted, the wicket was slightly soft, and they bowled in good areas, but we could have applied [ourselves] much better.\\\"\\n", "category": "generic"}

The new MacBook Pro is expected to be up to 3.5 times faster in processing power, and up to six times faster in graphics, compared to its predecessors powered by Intel processors. Apple's shift from Intel processors to its own custom-designed chips marks a significant change in the company's approach to hardware manufacturing. The move is set to make production more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly. However, the transition is not without its challenges, as software developers will need to adapt their applications to run smoothly on the new hardware. Apple plans to complete the two-year transition period by the end of 2022, with more products featuring the M1 chip expected to be unveiled in the coming months.\\\"\\n", "category": "generic"}

NCB will pay 28.45 riyals ($7.58) for each Samba share, according to a statement on Sunday, valuing it at about 55.7 billion riyals. NCB will offer 0.739 new shares for each Samba share, at the lower end of the 0.736-0.787 ratio the banks set when they signed an initial framework agreement in June. The offer is a 3.5% premium to Sambas Oct. 8 closing price of 27.50 riyals and about 24% higher than the level the shares traded at before the talks were made public. Bloomberg News first reported the merger discussions. The new bank will have total assets of more than $220 billion, creating the Gulf regions third-largest lender.

The landslide has destroyed vast areas of land and resulted in the evacuation of thousands of families. People are being housed in temporary shelters, schools, and government buildings. Prime Minister John Dearson has announced a state of emergency and called for international assistance to cope with the disaster. Relief funds have been initiated to help the victims, and the public is encouraged to donate in any way they could.

NCB will pay 28.45 riyals ($7.58) for each Samba share, according to a statement on Sunday, valuing it at about 55.7 billion riyals. NCB will offer 0.739 new shares for each Samba share, at the lower end of the 0.736-0.787 ratio the banks set when they signed an initial framework agreement in June. The offer is a 3.5% premium to Sambas Oct. 8 closing price of 27.50 riyals and about 24% higher than the level the shares traded at before the talks were made public. Bloomberg News first reported the merger discussions. The new bank will have total assets of more than $220 billion, creating the Gulf regions third-largest lender.

This move comes amidst growing concerns about the survival of journalism, as many media outlets struggle to maintain a steady revenue stream in the age of digital consumption. Google's program, called the 'Local Experiments Project,' seeks to bolster smaller newspapers that often bear the brunt of financial hardships in the industry. As part of the initiative, Google will provide funding for dozens of new publications, which will help support their day-to-day operations as well as their overall mission of providing quality journalism to their communities. According to Google, the first phase of this project will focus primarily on small urban communities in regions with limited access to local news. These communities will be selected based on criteria such as population size, location, and income levels, ensuring that they represent a diverse range of voices from various parts of the country. The tech giant's support of local news outlets aims to address the so-called 'news desert' phenomenon in which communities face a dearth of reliable sources for local news and information. The company's venture into local news also represents an opportunity for Google to cultivate stronger relationships with news organizations, which have long criticized the search engine giant's role in the decline of the journalism industry.\\\"\\n", "category": "generic"}

Pant revealed the incident made India skipper Virat Kohli upset. I think, somebody threw a ball inside, at Siraj, so he [Kohli] was upset, said Pant in a virtual press conference after the close of the first day's play.You can say whatever you want to chant, but don't throw things at the fielders and all those things. It is not good for cricket, I guess, he added. In the third session of the opening day of the third Test, a section of spectators seemed to have asked Siraj the score of the match to tease the pacer. The India pacer however came with a brilliant reply as he gestured 1-0 (India leading the Test series) towards the crowd. Earlier this month, during the second Test match, there was some bad crowd behaviour on a show as some unruly fans threw champagne corks at India batsman KL Rahul. Kohli also intervened and he was seen gesturing towards the opening batsman to know more about the incident. An over later, the TV visuals showed that many champagne corks were thrown inside the playing field, and the Indian players were visibly left frustrated.\\n", "category": "generic"}
